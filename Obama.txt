Atlanta was previously touted as a model city for implementing these recommendations from the Obama task force. How‚Äôd that work out?
@ElectionMapsCo We've been seeing lots of polls from former Obama states plus Arizona, Texas and Georgia. We need to see some marginal states that the Dems won in 2016 but then again if we are seeing good swings in those states then we can with confidence 2016 Dem states seem safe perhaps.
